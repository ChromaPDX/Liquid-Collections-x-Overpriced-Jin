Requirements

- Files must contain ONE .csv file. 
- Asset names must be sequential 0,1,2,3...n.[extension]. It doesn't matter at what number you begin. (Example: 131.png, 132.png).
- Images and other file types can be used in combination but they have to follow the asset naming convention above. (Example: 0.png and 0.mp4, 1.png and 1.glb, etc.)
- When minting, you will be asked to choose "When will you reveal your NFTs?". Choose "Reveal upon mint".
